# 🧠 Factorio Base Optimizer

An AI-powered tool to analyze and optimize Factorio base layouts using GPT-4.

## 💡 What It Does

You can upload:
- 🧱 **Blueprint strings** – just copy from Factorio via “Export to string”
- 📸 **Base screenshots** – for visual layout analysis *(coming soon)*

And receive:
- 📊 A detailed review of your factory’s layout
- 🎯 Specific suggestions: belt balancing, logistics, production alignment
- 🧱 A clean, improved **blueprint string** ready to import into the game

## 🛠 How It Works
1. Paste your base blueprint or upload an image
2. The optimizer detects inefficiencies and layout flaws
3. It returns recommendations + a cleaner, more scalable version of your base

## 📂 Example Workflow
1. Open your blueprint book in Factorio → "Export to string"
2. Paste the code into the tool
3. Get a response:
   - ✔️ Rebuilt main bus
   - ✔️ Organized production blocks
   - ✔️ Scalable and elegant layout
